# Physics-Data-Analysis
Python code designed for analyzing data, collected during the second and third year UofT practical physics course.

# Primary actions of the code:
`data analysis` Using the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package, the code is able to determine the chi-square and fit parameters given raw data, their uncertainty, and expected model function.

`plot data` Using the results of the data analysis, the function then proceeds to plot the raw data, the fitted plot, and the residuals. Additionally, it can plot a histogram of teh raw data, and provide the Gaussian and Poisson fits.
